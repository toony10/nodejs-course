# Node.js Mastery Course – TypeScript Implementation

This repository contains my implementation of the [Master Node course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/?couponCode=24T7MT260525G2) on Udemy. The course focuses on building a real-world RESTful API and web app using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, including authentication, security, payments, and more.

## 🧪 Course Progress

Each major section of the course has its own **branch**. Once I complete a section, I merge it into `main`. This allows you to track progress step-by-step as the course evolves.

## 📌 Notes

- The code is written in **TypeScript**.
- Transpiled JavaScript files (`.js`) are **not committed** to version control.
- This repo focuses on learning and implementing best practices, not production deployment.
- ESLint and Prettier used for formatting.

- Building custom servers using core modules (`http`, `fs`, etc.)
- Asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Routing and API design
- File I/O and streams
- Modular project organization
- TypeScript configuration and typing in Node.js
